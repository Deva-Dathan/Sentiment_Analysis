I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.
This kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach!!!
"Didnt know how much i'd use a kindle so went for the lower end. im happy with it, even if its a little dark"
"I am 100 happy with my purchase. I caught it on sale at a really good price. I am normally a real book person, but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages. The Kindle prevents that, it's extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book), and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another, without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model, which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard. Lol) and it most likely won't be my last."
Solid entry level Kindle. Great for kids. Gifted for a kid of my friend and they love to use it to read more than their iPads. battery is good but higher model is a bit better.
This make an excellent ebook reader. Don't expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it's cheap and good to read in the sun.
"I ordered this for my daughter, as I have the black paperwhite, and I love it. I read quite a bit and the larger books were driving me crazy having to hold them up while laying down, or wanting to take a book on vacation and lugging around a thick paperback, with this I can throw it in my bag and read anywhere. Its light weight, easy to use, the battery life lasts for weeks, which makes it an all around awesome device. My daughter is in public school and they offer an online library for E-Readers, so she can now download books for free from school! You can also download your own public library app (if your county offers that) and read free from there as well. You can shop for e-books straight from the device through Amazon.com."
I bought my Kindle about 2 months ago and the battery is already dead and will not charge
"amazon kindle is always the best ebook, upgrade every new model"
"It's beyond my expectation, and it can even show music score. Not fast turning though."
If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional. The battery lasts a long time and the screen is easy on the eyes. The only difficulty sometimes is reading in extremely bright environments. Overall an excellent buy.
"Love my kindle, makes reading at night so easy and it feels like you are reading a real book."
Good product for child. Who only need to read the books
This Kindle is a convenient size yet lettering is easy to read.
"I use this every day on my commute. Great battery life, no backlight but very readable with normal lighting. I like the built in dictionary. Email yourself pdf or mobi files for easy transfers."
It does its job but I would buy one which the screen is brighter. There are times that it's difficult to read because screen is not too bright
Great product for myself! And I bought it when there was great deal on it!
Item work well and was easy to read from in day light
Great product and service will refer to a friend. And the sales man r good
Everything is great except that i can't read external pdfs properly. Either it zooms too much of too little. For kindle books it provides great experience. Battery life is awesome!
"I was looking for a kindle whitepaper. I saw online for $80. What a deal. I ordered it on line and picked it up in the store. I got it home and couldn't adjust the brightness. After a lengthy time with online customer service I called customer service. After 20 minuets with speaking to a female Elmer Fud that doesn't speak english well I figured I would just return it. Although it looks Identical to the $120 model, you can not adjust the brightness. That would have been good information before I bought it."
This is a nice bare-bones reading device. Easy to set up and use. My greatest issue is that it isn't back lit so it can't be used w/o a light on in the room. Returning it an purchasing a paperwhite instead.
"Easy to use and navigate, purchasing books is fast and simple and I love the fact that I can password protect this device"
The Amazon Kindle is light weight and easy to use.
"I love hear readers, I had to replace mine because I destroyed the last, but it is awesome"
Love the simplicity. Also love that I use it for reading only and can't download distracting apps.
My husband loves this Kindle. He has a muscular disease keeping him from being able to handle anything with much weight at all. This is perfect.
I've wanted a kindle for a while and decided to get it when BB put it on sale. I am not disappointed.
I have several Kindles so knew what to expect. It is a great reading device and I keep several in different locations.
"I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books."
My fianc?©e really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.
"Simple, great buy for your money if you are an avid reader."
I like the changes that have been made since my current 4 year old unit was purchased
Fits nicely in your hand and its touchable. increase the size of the fonts
"Great buy, do a lot of reading and he no glear screen is awesome while in the sun."
I lie the size and weight for the kindle-makes it very convenient to take large books with me in digital format.
Great price and works great for book reading. Would recommend
Got it when it was on sale. Totally fall in love with it. Bring with it me everywhere.
I never used kindle before. My wife gifted me on my birthday. This is the amazing product. I am using it for daily reading. The display is fantastic and no strain on eyes.
I bought this with paper white and didn‚Äôt see much of a difference in terms of resolution and use. I totally recommend this reader as it‚Äôs so small and powerful!
The sales people are really nice and knowledgeable to me I will come back again
I'm a longtime Kindle user and jumped at the opportunity to bring my granddaughter into the fold with this gift. She loved it!
"Overall good product, does what is advertised, comfortable to use."
"The kindle has come in very handy lately, I always have a book to read and this is great to just grab on the go. Battery life is great, only drawback is no backlight."
"I am loving my new Kindle! I have wanted one for a while and finally bought one, and even though it was the cheapest one, it has exceeded my expectations. I love how there is no glare."
"I already has an older version of the Kindle, but this one is even better. I love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons."
"Bought this for my 90+ year-old, totally no-tech mom. Her first e-book is Gone with the Wind. She likes the size and ease of use."
"Amazon kindle products have always been reliable, consistent quality and this is no different. Very happy with it."
working well and very cheap if we think in the price way
